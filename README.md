# Readable_Optimization
This is contributed to maximize UX for Readable(https://readable.jp/translate) and the life of reading papers by extention.

・<paper_split.py> can split pdf file into some pdf files following the rules of size Readable enacted(Under 100Pages and 50MB). You can use it before uploading.
・<paper_merge.py> is scraping app that your works between to upload and to download are automated.
・<readable_fever.py> can merge some split pdf files to upload  into one pdf file. You can use it after downloading translated files from Readable.

First, You must check chrome version with "chrome://version" and download matching version of Chrome driver from here. Simultaneously, it would be better to copy "Profile Path".
After downloading, you can put on it wherever you like, but the directory path is needed. So I recommend to place it in the same location as pdf files.
At last, you set the directory path, profile path, and profile. finished.

* The system needs login and subscription for Readable Pro.
